CSS code is generated by SASS, we use the .scss syntax. We prefer a component based
approach using the BEM methodology: https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/.

In addition to BEM we limit the scope of components to the "border-box" preventing
components from defining a margin on itself. Parent components control the margins
of its children.

The view is a component without parents and should be directly linked to a template.
It's role is to "orchestrate" child components.

To compile SASS to CSS run::

    $ gulp sass

To create a new component run ::

    $ gulp create-component --name my-compoment-name --scss

To create a new view run ::

    $ gulp create-view --name my-compoment-name --scss
