  title: Kownsl - advices and approvals
  version: 0.1.0
  description: |2

    Manage case-oriented advices and approvals.

    Kownsl allows you to store review requests on a case with (a subset of) its documents,
    and present the review requests to assignees. The advice or approval from reviewers
    is subsequently again stored in Kownsl.

    This component publishes notifications on the `kownsl` channel.
